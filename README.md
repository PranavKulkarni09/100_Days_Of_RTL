# 100_Days_Of_RTL
Welcome to the 100 Days of RTL challenge! This challenge is designed to help strengthen your skills in RTL (Register Transfer Level) Design by working on a series of hands-on projects and tasks over 100 days. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your RTL knowledge, this repository will guide you through exercises related to Verilog, SystemVerilog, and Design Verification.

# The goal of this challenge is to:

- Develop a solid understanding of RTL Design with Verilog and SystemVerilog.
- Learn important Digital Design topics like combinational and sequential circuits, finite state machines (FSMs), and pipelining.
- Learn Synthesis, Simulation, and Logic.
- Use Design Verification techniques with assertions and testbenches.
- Complete daily coding exercises, project implementations, and gradually tackle complex designs.
